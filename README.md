# legendary-system - Visualization projects

1) Visualizing Covid-19: project (notebook.ipynb)

My recently uploaded notebook.ipynb with csv files has a project done by me, as a practice for my R skills to visualize the moving trends of Covid. It is not based upon the most recent data, however, it does show some trend lines turning points etc. Details are given in notebook to follow along. It is based upon r programming. Enjoy!

2) Canada immigration dataset ipynb: 

It is another data visualization project where using python libraries the immigration to Canada from worldover for the period 1980 to 2013 is studied. Various plots like line, area, histogram, bar is used along with waffle chart and wordmap which I find interesting. Also, seaborn for regression plot is used. It is a practice for using various techniques for data visualization and how to make informative plots about data, where often picture speaks a thousand word in itself.
