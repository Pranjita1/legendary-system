Visualizing Covid-19: project

My recently uploaded notebook.ipynb with csv files has a project done by me, as a practice for my R skills to visualize the moving trends of Covid. It is not based upon the most recent data, however, it does show some trend lines turning points etc. Details are given in notebook to follow along. It is based upon r programming. Enjoy!
